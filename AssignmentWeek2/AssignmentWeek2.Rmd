#I started with downloading ODD May 2018 Retail Sales Data from its [website](http://www.odd.org.tr/web_2837_1/neuralnetwork.aspx?type=36)
#Then I put this data to my github repository, changing its name to 'odd_retail_sales_2018_05.xlsx'

#First I installed and loaded the readxl package
```{r}
#install.packages("readxl")
```

```{r}
#library(readxl)
```

# Create a temporary file

```{r}
tmp<-tempfile(fileext=".xlsx")
```
# Download file from repository to the temp file
```{r}
download.file("https://github.com/MEF-BDA503/pj18-EmreKemerci/blob/master/AssignmentWeek2/odd_retail_sales_2018_05.xlsx?raw=true",destfile=tmp)
```
# Read that excel file using readxl package's read_excel function. You might need to adjust the parameters (skip, col_names) according to your raw file's format.
```{r}
raw_data<-readxl::read_excel(tmp,skip=7,col_names=FALSE)
```

# Remove the temp file

```{r}
file.remove(tmp)
```
